  <h3>Why did we start this amazing blog?</h3>
  <h4>Finding a good brunch spot is a make or break weekend decision, it’s not one to take lightly, after all, everyone knows brunch is the most important meal of the weekend! Whether it be bottomless and boozy, comfort-food or something a little bit more luxurious, we’ve listed some of our favourite hotspots! We started crashproject.com because we are completely obsessed with telling everyone about amazing food London has to offer. From sitting on a kerb street food to special occasion (but still affordable) 5* dining, there is seriously no other place like it in the world. Here you won’t find reviews as such but just a friend chatting about where’s good, what to expect and things to order. Along with tips, bucket lists and a monthly food social if you want to get involved. We always say if you’ve eaten in London, you’ve eaten the whole world.
